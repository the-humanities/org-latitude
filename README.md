org-latitude
============

Add some location-based notifications to org-mode.

latitude scrapes your current location based off of your google
latitude location. If, within the margin of error given by latitude,
you have moved into an area, the program sends you an email with all of the 
todo-items tagged with that location.

Requires curl to scrape the data.

This is my first-ever elisp project, so don't expect anything special.
